# Setup — SaaS Finance

Grok Bot is a durable teammate on a cloud computer. Official docs: [Get started](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/get-started) · [Bots](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/bots) · [Approvals](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/approvals-security-and-privacy).

## 1. Create the Bot

1. In Grok Bot, **New** → **Create new agent** (or `Cmd/Ctrl+N`).
2. **Bot actions → Edit Profile**.
3. Name: **SaaS Finance**
4. Title: Weekly collected-revenue memo
5. Paste `PROFILE.md` (this folder) into the description.

Or skip the form and paste this file into an installer Bot with [START.md](../../START.md).

## 2. Plugins

1. **Gmail** — Settings → Plugins → Add

Installed connectors are account-wide. They are **not** isolated to this Bot. Sign out of a service when it should no longer be available to the rest of your roster.

## 3. First task

Send:

> Build this week's collected-revenue memo from finance mail: payments received, renewals in window, and past-due notices. Compare to last week's memo if it exists. Do not refund, do not send dunning, and do not change invoices.

Autonomy is **L1**. Week one is read-and-prepare unless you promote the Bot.

## 4. Save a skill

When the output is reviewable on a second input, ask:

> Save the process we just used as a skill called “weekly-saas-finance”. Include sources, output format, validation, and the rule that external actions always require approval.

## 5. Routine

Only after two good skill runs:

> Every Mondays 10:00 in the Bot timezone, run the weekly-saas-finance skill. Confirm timezone in Settings → Agent before enabling. Week one stays L1. Post the result in this conversation. If the source is unavailable, report the failure instead of using old data. Do not take external actions.

Then **Test run**. A test run performs real work.

## 6. Share

The share link is public. Adding it copies the configuration, not your computer or logins. Strip secrets first. See [docs/sharing.md](../../docs/sharing.md) and the [third-party bot terms](https://x.ai/legal/bot-sharing-terms).
