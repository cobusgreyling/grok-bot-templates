# Setup — Outbound

Grok Bot is a durable teammate on a cloud computer. Official docs: [Get started](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/get-started) · [Bots](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/bots) · [Approvals](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/approvals-security-and-privacy).

## 1. Create the Bot

1. In Grok Bot, **New** → **Create new agent** (or `Cmd/Ctrl+N`).
2. **Bot actions → Edit Profile**.
3. Name: **Outbound**
4. Title: Account research and review-ready outreach
5. Paste `PROFILE.md` (this folder) into the description.

Or skip the form and paste this file into an installer Bot with [START.md](../../START.md).

## 2. Plugins

1. **Gmail** — Settings → Plugins → Add
1. **LinkedIn** — Settings → Plugins → Add

Installed connectors are account-wide. They are **not** isolated to this Bot. Sign out of a service when it should no longer be available to the rest of your roster.

## 3. First task

Send:

> Research the accounts in this CRM view or attached list. Score them against our ICP and recent intent, identify up to three contacts per account, and draft email and LinkedIn outreach in the style examples attached. Skip anyone already in an active sequence. Return a review list; do not send or enroll anyone.

Autonomy is **L1**. Week one is read-and-prepare unless you promote the Bot.

## 4. Save a skill

When the output is reviewable on a second input, ask:

> Save the process we just used as a skill called “research-accounts”. Include sources, output format, validation, and the rule that external actions always require approval.

## 5. Routine

Only after two good skill runs:

> Every weeknights 18:00 in the Bot timezone, run the research-accounts skill. Use Settings → Agent timezone. Post the result in this conversation. If the source is unavailable, report the failure instead of using old data. Do not take external actions.

Then **Test run**. A test run performs real work.

## 6. Share

The share link is public. Adding it copies the configuration, not your computer or logins. Strip secrets first. See [docs/sharing.md](../../docs/sharing.md) and the [third-party bot terms](https://x.ai/legal/bot-sharing-terms).
